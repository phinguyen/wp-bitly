# WP Bitly

This the GitHub development repository for the WordPress plugin found [here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-bitly/).

Use the Bitly API to generate shortlinks for all of your posts and pages instead of the internal http://www.yourdomain.com/?p=1 short links WordPress generates.

* **Current Version**:  2.6


## History
Unfortunately, WP Bit.ly plugin has been discontinued. And as the v3 API from bit.ly will be discontinued March 1 2020, the plug-in will stop functioning at that date. I will try to continue develop this plugin in order to make it working with v4 API.
